So what exactly is **Glassmorphism**? As guessed by its name, it has a *glassy texture with transparency*. If you're into front-end development, it will take you a handful of time to understand the trend and use it right away!

I have included code blocks below and a link to a live example of the glassmorphism effect generated by me below. You will also find some resources to help you out with it. Hope it helps.

So we can generate the glassmorphism effect by a CSS property: `background-blur`.

Background blur creates a **frosted-glass effect **that ultimately leads to a **transparent glassy look** to our design.



### Glassmorphism Without Outline

> 
You can set and adjust the properties according to you.

```css
background: rgba( 255, 255, 255, 0.25 );
box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba( 31, 38, 135, 0.37 );
backdrop-filter: blur( 3.0px );
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur( 3.0px );
border-radius: 10px;
``` 
Let's try to understand each property used here.

`background`: it sets background effects for our element.

`box-shadow`: it adds shadows to an element.

`backdrop-filter`: it is used to apply filter effects like blur, grayscale, contrast, etc. {major role in glassmorphism} 

`border-radius`: generates rounded corners to our shapes/elements.

### Glassmorphism with outline (bring more realistic look)

> 
I like this one :)

```css
background: rgba( 255, 255, 255, 0.25 );
box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba( 31, 38, 135, 0.37 );
backdrop-filter: blur( 3.0px );
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur( 3.0px );
border-radius: 10px;

border: 1px solid rgba( 255, 255, 255, 0.18 );  #for creating outline
``` 

Did you observe the difference? Just one line of code is required** to add an outline effect** to your design.

```css
border: 1px solid rgba( 255, 255, 255, 0.18 );  #for creating outline
```
