# My #14daysofbreakloop Journey

> Hey there. In this blog, I'll be sharing my insights on the #14daysofbreakloop challenge organized by @100daysofcodes.

### BackStory 🤛

So first of all, this challenge is a part of **#100DaysOfCode**. If you don't know, it's a commitment to yourself:  
"*I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days*." 

**You tweet every day about your progress and work.**

I started the same on Feb 3, 2021. Then I found [@100daysofcodes](https://twitter.com/100daysofcodes) and downloaded their [extension](https://t.co/ZNVBpyN5pf?amp=1). This is really helping me to stay consistent.

### How It Started 🙅‍♀️

I joined the **#14daysofbreakloop** on 24 Feb. I haven't done any such challenges before or joined any hackathons (*even if I had numerous plans in my tiny mind*) due to my imposter syndrome... So to overcome this, I decided to participate and so made a plan 3 days before and figured out what I'll be making on each day.** I wasn't afraid anymore. **

These 14 days went amazing and helped me polish my skills so much and I'm glad I decided to do the challenge! 🙂
